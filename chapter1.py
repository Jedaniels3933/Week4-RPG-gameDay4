You awaken with a start, your breath ragged and cold as it billows into the misty air. The ground beneath you is damp, covered in a thick carpet of decaying leaves, their once vibrant colors long since faded to a lifeless brown. Tall, twisted trees loom above, their gnarled branches clawing at the murky sky like skeletal hands reaching for salvation. A faint glow filters through the dense canopy, casting eerie shadows that dance and flicker as if alive.
